# Introduction to Pytest

Made in 18th September 2021.

## An overview

[Pytest is a python package](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x) where we write automated tests for our coded project. The reason we write tests for our code is to ensure the code runs the way we want. Writing automated tests can also make the process of testing our code easier, faster and more consistent.

We can develop tests first, in the case of test-driven development, and then build our code while using these automated tests to ensure we are heading in the correct direction.

We can also use the tests to ensure the changes we make to the code don't cause untended errors later in the pathway of our development.

Most modern packages come with automated testing code, so it is a great way to make your code look professional.
